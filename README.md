MTG DeckBuilder

Built purely with Java as an excercize in objects, data IO, and UI design.

UI uses JavaFX

Currently reads and writes all cards to files. When displayed in the UI, it loads an ArrayList which is ungodly slow and does not work for the massive number of cards in MTG. Going forward I would like to impliment a database so that I can use the functionality SQL provides and take advantage of the speed.
